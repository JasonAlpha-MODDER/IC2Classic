IC2Classic Bugtracker, Texture Tracker

Also all API Files are in here...

If you want to help me out look into the Needed Textures List,
since i am adding new stuff i also need Textures for these things,
Sadly i am not a Texturer (i wish i could paint), so i rely on other people with that.

Here is the Texture List:

And here is the Texture Tracker:
